### Logo 
<img src="images/logonew.png" alt="Centsible Logo" width="200"/>

- The **Centsible** logo features a stylized ‚ÄúC‚Äù that resembles a cent symbol (¬¢), immediately conveying that the app is focused on money management. The primary logo color is
  **green (#A1DC7C)**, symbolizing financial growth and stability. This color choice ties into the global association of green with currency and prosperity.

| **Black**  | `#000000`  | Main background color. Provides strong contrast and enhances text readability, critical for financial clarity.|
| **Grey**   | `#3A3A3A`  | Used for secondary text and icons. Offers a subtle visual hierarchy without distracting from core elements. |
| **White**  | `#FFFFFF`  | Primary text color. Enhances readability against dark backgrounds, maintaining a bold and professional appearance. |
